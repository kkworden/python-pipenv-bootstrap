# Python Pipenv Bootstrap

A super-simple Python3 application that uses Pipenv for dependency management.

Pipenv is nice because it creates a virtualenv automatically, effectively sandboxing this app
from all other Python projects on your local machine!

## Pre-requisites
You will need to install:

* Python3
* Pipenv

## Running the app
Execute:

```
./runapp.sh
```

## Tests
Execute:

```
./runtests.sh
```
